This is a game where you guess a number between 1 and 100 using the Rust language.

When the game starts, the program remembers a random number between 1 and 100 and says "Guess!" and "Guess!".

Then the user inputs a number repeatedly until it matches the number the program remembered.

To start the game, follow these steps:

```
git clone https://github.com/aria-0124/Programming_Guessing_Game.git

run ./target/debug/guessing_game.exe
```
